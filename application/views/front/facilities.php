      <div id="tabata" class="tabcontent">
          <p>Originated from Japan by a scientist Dr. Izumi Tabata and his team, Tabata is a popular form of
            high-intensity interval training (HIIT), featuring a series of exercises which last four minutes each.
            The structure of Tabata has an HIIT workout for 20 seconds and rest for 10 seconds. This is one set; you have to complete eight sets
            of each exercise. As compared to any other form of workout, Tabata has the highest impact on both, the aerobic and
            anaerobic system. At LMF, we train people in groups for this, which includes squats, push-ups, burpees and many other
            exercises that work on your large muscle groups. This workout is intended towards, weight loss, boosting your metabolism,
            improving your bone mass density and stamina. If you are short of time, and you need to work out as well, Tabata is for you.

      <div id="boxing" class="tabcontent">
          <p>Boxing is not just a sport, but also a form of high intensity training that increases your metabolism, burns good number of calories
             while you train, and burns even more when you are out of the gym. At LMF, we train people who have an affinity towards boxing and
             self-defense, through equipment and personal trainers. Here you will learn the technique of throwing the 6 basic punches,
             the technique of getting back to stance after each punch and to throw while moving. It is a great form of training for total body
             strength and power since it uses the entire body from head to toe.

      <div id="yoga" class="tabcontent">
          <p>The most ancient form of fitness, yoga, is based on the principle of balance between mind, body and soul. With stress and
            anxiety becoming as common as cold and flu these days, the first thing that goes out of balance is our breath. This means less oxygen
            to the body and more carbon dioxide storage, which leads to several other health issues. So bringing our breath back to balance
            is the first step towards managing stress. At LMF, our experienced yoga instructors help you get this right by guiding
            you towards right body postures, meditation and most importantly-healthy breathing patterns that help you get ample oxygen,
            making you achieve balance between mind, body and soul.
